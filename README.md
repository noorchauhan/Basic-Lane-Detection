# Basic-Lane-Detection
This is one of my projects where I have applied my personal Learnings of implementing a basic lane detection pipeline for an autonomous vehicle
I will be adding Notes soon, please keep in mind, the notes were designed for my personal understanding & might not be clean for many of you,
