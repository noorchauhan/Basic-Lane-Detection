# Basic-Lane-Detection
This is one of my projects where I have applied my personal Learnings of implementing a basic lane detection pipeline for an autonomous vehicle
You can find my basic understanding in the notes PDF file, I have not added comments/ Makrdown in the main notebook as it does not look clean to me, you can build your own accordingly
